  <h2>Angular v2 - New York's 2nd biggest attraction just after excellent NYC pizza</h2>
  <p>One attribute that defines most New Yorkers is they appear to be constantly on the move. It's no wondered at all of that this is regarded as the busiest city in the world. The dining choices that this city offers represent this restless energy, that makes it a wonderful place for tourists since they could readily eat while they're on the move. There are plenty of intriguing locations to eat all over this city that you'll seldom find yourself in an area when you're moving around this place. If you're visiting New York, you'll definitely be spending a great deal of time walking around or travelling from the metro.</p>
  <p>This can be what most New Yorkers do and you'll find it to be the easiest way to get around. You will thus be glad to see that we have plenty of restaurants found near subway stations and in the neighborhood of attractions for tourist. Lots of them are frequented from locals and so are definitely not overpriced tourist traps. You could get an excellent pizza or hamburger NYC fashion at these places at affordable costs.</p>
  <p>In addition, there are plenty of mobile food booths selling ethnic foods which are incredibly delicious and great to eat while on the go. You'll find intriguing restaurants in every aspect of Big Apple, no matter if you're at Union Square, Madison Square Garden or in the now trendy Meatpacking District. <a href="./test/">It'd definitely be a fine idea to do some reading</a> before you go on your trip in order that you don't miss out on a signature dish that the certain restaurant or food booth provides. Many mobile food stalls may be tracked on-line so you know precisely where they'll be on certain days or at specific times of the day.</p>
