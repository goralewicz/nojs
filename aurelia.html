  <h1>New Orleans - house of JazzCon</h1>
  <p>The two comparable looking buildings on each side of the St. Louis's Cathedral is the Presbytere to the right as well as the Cabildo to the left. Now it holds the Mardi Gras Museum of the Louisiana State Museum. The Cabildo is the more historical of the two buildings. The front room on the 2nd floor had been where the official transfer of the Louisiana Purchase from France to the US was made. France had recovered commanded over the Louisiana colony only 3 weeks before it had been transferred to the US. France's catastrophic loss of the French colony of Haiti from the slave rebellion persuaded France ruler, Napoleon Bonaparte, that Louisiana wasn't significant to his empire.</p>
  <p innerhtml.bind="p2" class="au-target" au-target-id="3"><a href="/aurelia/test/">The Americans were becoming frustrated with the authorities of New Orleans</a> for limiting trade on the Mississippi River and confiscated their cargoes in the port of New Orleans. The American discouragement had reached the stage that some citizens of Kentucky were planning to attack New Orleans. In an effort to head off problem as well as to improve trade for the interior USA, President Thomas Jefferson offered to purchase the Isle of New Orleans from Napoleon for $3 million. Napoleon surprised Jefferson by providing to sell the whole Louisiana colony for $15 million. Napoleon needed the money to fund his war on England.</p>
  <p>The US didn't have sufficient money for the purchase. In an ironic twist, the US borrowed the funds from England to pay to Napoleon, who subsequently used the funds to assault England. After Louisiana was transferred to the US, the Cabildo served as a town hall as well as Supreme Court for Louisiana before it had been transformed In a part of the Louisiana State Museum. Today it holds several historical objects from old Louisiana including the death mask of Napoleon. Some scientists claim that he had been a pirate while some claim that he had been a gentleman privateer.</p>
  <p>The distinction between pirate as well as privateer is a matter of degrees. A pirate was a questionable assassin who attacked ships and towns, murdering everybody for money and treasure. In reality, these detainees attacked any weaker ship, irrespective of the flag it sailed under, murdered the crew, as well as sold the freight. The little Louisiana city of Barataria, sixty miles south of New Orleans, had been a favored home for many of those pirates. The local retailers wanted to purchase the very inexpensive, stolen goods, however they were afraid to cope with the dangerous pirates. Sometime in 1806 Jean Lafitte as well as his brother Pierre established their locksmith shop on St. Philip St.</p>
